<h1>About</h1>
<p>Themis is a staged, pipeline-oriented data processing framework designed
  for building data processing systems with a high degree of per-node
  efficiency.</p>

<p>Systems built on Themis hold
  four <a href="http://www.sortbenchmark.org">large-scale sorting records</a>
  as of 2012:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indy GraySort: TritonSort</li>
  <li>Indy 100GB JouleSort: TritonSort</li>
  <li>Daytona GraySort: ThemisMR</li>
  <li>Daytona 100GB JouleSort: ThemisMR</li>
</ul>

<h1>Systems</h1>
<h2>ThemisMR: An I/O-Efficient MapReduce</h2>
<p>ThemisMR is a MapReduce implementation architected for a high degree of
  per-node efficiency.  It achieves this high performance by reading and
  writing each record to disk exactly twice, which is the minimum amount
  possible for data sets that cannot fit in main memory.</p>

<h2>TritonSort: A Balanced Large-Scale Sorting System</h2>
<p>TritonSort is case study in building balanced computing systems,
  specifically data-intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems. TritonSort
  is a staged, pipeline-oriented sorting system designed to process data with
  a very high degree of per-node efficiency.</p>
